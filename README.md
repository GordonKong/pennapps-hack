## Inspiration 
During the coronavirus pandemic, prices of certain consumer goods are inflated. We aim to provide price transparency and awareness to customers.
## What it does
In our price guide, people can compare the prices of commonly sought out products during this time. This can help them make cost-effective choices.
## How I built it
We scraped data off of common marketplaces like Amazon and eBay and displayed the information. We did this with Python, Flask, MongoDB and ParseHub
## Challenges I ran into
As with any project, there were a lot of learning and being stuck on lines of code. Also, the virtual aspect of the event made things like communication harder, but we persevered. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Happy to have something to present
## What I learned
We learned how to scrape data off of websites.
## What's next for Costly Covid
We need to scrape more websites for more products, and organize the listings for a more pleasant user experience.
